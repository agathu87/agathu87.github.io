<p>Life is a journey, every day is a journey, success is a journey, web development is a journey. They say that a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step, as an aspiring web developer I would say that the journey of web development begins with one web page. As I begin this journey, I start withy the creation of my first web page, a page of my story, my life, hope you enjoy.</p>
